# Requirements
Given an XML string write a function that returns true if the string is a valid XML string; otherwise return false.
- A string is a valid XML string if it satisfies the following rules:
    - Each starting element must have a corresponding ending element
    - Nesting of elements within each other must be well nested, which means start first must end last. For example, <tutorial><topic>XML</topic></tutorial> is a correct way of nesting but <tutorial><topic>XML</tutorial></topic> is not
To simplify the question, we treat a pair of  opening tag and closing tags as matching only if the strings in both tags are identical. We donâ€™t need to parse extra components like attributes in the XML tag. 

# Restrictions
Usage of `System.XML` and `Regular Expression` are **prohibited**
Function signature should be: `bool DetermineXml(string xml)`
